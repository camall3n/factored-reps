# Factored Reps



## Installation

#### Download the repo:
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/camall3n/factored-reps.git
```

#### Install the dependencies:

The visual gridworld experiments and the DeepMind Control experiments were originally developed in separate repositories, so it's better to use a separate virtual environment for each. The installation instructions can be found in the respective README files in each experiment folder:
- Visual Gridworld: `markov_abstr/gridworld/README.md`
- DeepMind Control: `markov_abstr/dmcontrol/README.md`
